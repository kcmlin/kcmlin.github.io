Below are some running heatmaps of my past adventures. They were put together using my *Garmin*, [*Strava*](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3104875), [*Strava Multiple Ride Mapper (SMRM)*](http://www.jonathanokeeffe.com/strava/map.php) and the *Preview* software on Mac. *Garmin* recorded the routes and synced with *Strava*. I use *Strava* to manage workouts. *SMRM* pulled information from *Strava* and overlaid the routes together (with some tweaks in setting). *Preview* was used at the end to add a location name and a timestamp.
