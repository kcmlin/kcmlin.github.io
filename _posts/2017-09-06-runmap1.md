Here are some running heatmaps of my past adventures. It was put together using my Garmin, [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/3104875), [Strava Multiple Ride Mapper](http://www.jonathanokeeffe.com/strava/map.php) and the Preview software on Mac. Garmin recorded the routes and synced with Strava. I used Strava to manage workouts. Strava Multiple Ride Mapper pulled information from Strava and overlaid the routes together (with some tweaks in setting). Preview was used at the end to add a location name and a timestamp.
